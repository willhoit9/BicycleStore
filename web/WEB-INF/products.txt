1|Atlantis|2300.95|The Atlantis is our most versatile bike, our best-seller, and as evidence of its mature design, is virtually unchanged since we introduced it as our first production bike. It is ideal for loaded touring, trail riding, commuting, and general riding where you're likely to want tires 35mm wide or wider most of the time, and fenders a lot of the time. Around here, we have a saying: You can do anything on an Atlantis. Because you can.|images/frame.jpg
2|Wheelset|389.95|Velocity Rims 3-crossed onto Phil Hubs. All of our wheels are 3x (three-cross), use butted DT spokes, and well, they're just no nonsense wheels for all-around hard use riding.|images/wheel.jpg

Therefore, it is hard to get wider tires out. However, Tektro has increased the width that it opens as well as added on a safety lock devise.|images/brake.jpg
5|Derailleur|67.95|MicroShift Standard Rear Derailer. Polished, not painted, silver, and with a CNC-machined cage--basically, a black cage with machined-off metal to expose the silver, like a racing stripe. It's a nice-looking derailer suitable for any bike. Shifts to 36T.|images/shift.jpg
